# New Zealand Legal Marketplace

## Project Description

Your project is a comprehensive online marketplace designed to connect individuals in New Zealand with legal professionals. It encompasses several key features:

**Landing Page**: This is the entry point where users can describe their legal issues using text or voice input.

**Lawyer Search**: Allows users to search for lawyers based on location (city, region) and type of legal service needed.

**User Dashboard**: Enables users to track their legal queries, view matched lawyer profiles, and communicate with potential advisors.

**Lawyer Profile**: Provides detailed information about individual lawyers, including their expertise, experience, client reviews, and contact details.

**Lawyer Dashboard**: Allows lawyers to view available legal issues posted by users and bid on cases matching their expertise.

**Legal Issue Review and Lawyer List**: After a user inputs their issue, this screen displays the categorized legal issue in an editable format and lists qualified lawyers, with filters for languages spoken, expertise with specific populations, and office accessibility.

**Login Page**: Offers login options via email or Gmail.

**Profile Creation Page**: Appears after login, prompting users to select their role (individual or lawyer) and presenting role-specific forms.

**Individual Profile Form**: Collects personal information from individuals seeking legal help, such as age, gender, name, location, and preferred language, with a language selection dropdown.
