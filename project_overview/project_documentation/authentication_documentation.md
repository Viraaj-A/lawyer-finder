 What's Been Implemented:

  1. Supabase Client Utilities

  - lib/supabase/client.ts: Browser client for client-side auth
  - lib/supabase/server.ts: Server client for server-side operations

  2. Authentication Middleware (middleware.ts)

  - Automatically refreshes auth tokens
  - Protects /dashboard routes (redirects to home if not authenticated)
  - Handles cookie management for server-side rendering

  3. Server Actions (app/actions/auth.ts)

  - login(): Email/password login
  - signup(): New user registration
  - signOut(): User logout
  - signInWithGoogle(): OAuth Google login

  4. Auth Callback Route (app/auth/callback/route.ts)

  - Handles OAuth redirects from Supabase
  - Exchanges auth codes for sessions

  5. Updated AuthProvider

  - Listens to Supabase auth state changes
  - Provides user context throughout the app
  - Auto-refreshes user session

  6. Enhanced LoginForm

  - Email/password authentication with Supabase
  - Google OAuth integration
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Password field added for secure login

  Learn by Doing

  Context: The authentication system is now fully integrated with Supabase. The login form works with email/password and Google OAuth. After successful login, users are redirected to /dashboard/user, but you'll need to decide on the actual post-login flow based on user roles.

  Your Task: In components/auth/LoginForm.tsx, implement the post-login navigation logic in the handleSubmit function. Look for TODO(human). Consider checking if the user has completed their profile, and redirect them to onboarding if not, or to the appropriate dashboard based on their
  role.

  Guidance: You might want to fetch the user's profile from Supabase to check their role (individual vs lawyer) and profile completion status. Consider using the Supabase client to query a profiles table, then navigate to /onboarding for new users, /dashboard/lawyer for lawyers, or
  /dashboard/user for individuals.

  Next Steps:

  1. Make sure your .env.local file has the correct Supabase credentials:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  2. Set up Google OAuth in your Supabase dashboard if you want to use Google login
  3. Run the project with pnpm dev and test the login functionality!

  The authentication system is now ready to use with your Supabase backend!
