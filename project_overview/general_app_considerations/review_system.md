Whether a review system is required and how it would work. 

For example, maybe angry customers would always leave lawyers with bad reviews.

On the other hand, maybe some customers waste the time of lawyers. 

How would I deal with the above, a secret review system for lawyers. Whereas lawyers are not reviewed at all. Maybe another type of review could be, did lawyer get in touch, availability type reviews.
